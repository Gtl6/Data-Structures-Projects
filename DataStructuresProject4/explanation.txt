Insert Sort
Sort Time: 855,893
Moves: 18259

Selection Sort
Sort Time: 6,778,454
Moves: 501500

Merge Sort
Sort Time: 5,181,014
Moves: 246724

While exactly quantifying moves is a weird idea, it makes sense that Insert Sort would be faster than Selection Sort.
Merge sort should be better for much, much larger data, but for relatively small data sets (only 1000 elements) it
could make sense that it's less efficient to make new arrays.
